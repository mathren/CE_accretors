#+Title: Scripts to manage running grids

These are tuned to run on my workstation, but should be easily
adaptable to other workflows.

- =setup_binaries.py= was used to create the binary runs using as
  =TEMPLATE= MESA work directory =../binaries/template_binary=
- =setup_single_stars.py= was used to create the single stars with the
  =TEMPLATE= MESA work directory =../single_stars/template_single=
- =setup_grid_simplified.py= was used to create the engineered models
  with the =TEMPLATE= MESA work directory
  =../engineered_stars/same_core/template_engineered/= and using the
  input composition and entropy profile created starting from
  non-rotating single star models with
  =../engineered_stars/make_simplified_chem_profiles.ipynb=
  and saved in =../engineered_stars/input_profiles/=

For each grid of models, these scripts also produce a tarball of the
exact folder used as =TEMPLATE= at the time of running, which is
available at the zenodo deposit associated with this repository.

** How to reproduce our MESA run

   To obtain bit-to-bit identical results to those in our paper, we
   recommend downloading from zenodo the tarball associated to the
   runs you want to reproduce, insert the input parameters for the
   specific run within the grid of models computed with that tarball,
   and run =MESA version 15140=, =MESA SDK x86_64-linux-20.12.1=.

   The files in this repo may evolve in time after publication of the
   manuscript.
