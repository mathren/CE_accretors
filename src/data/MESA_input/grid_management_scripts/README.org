#+Title: Scripts to manage running grids

These are tuned to run on my workstation, but should be easily
adaptable to other workflows.

- =setup_binaries.py= was used to create the binary runs
- =setup_single_stars.py= was used to create the single stars
- =setup_grid_simplified.py= was used to create the engineered models
  (see also =./engineered_stars=)
