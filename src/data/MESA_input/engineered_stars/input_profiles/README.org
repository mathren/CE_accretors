#+Title: "Engineered" models

These simplified profiles are intended as numerical experiments to
check trends in the binding energy of RSG envelopes with thickness of
core-envelope boundary.

These were created with the notebook =make_simplified_chem_profiles.ipynb= starting
from a non-rotating 20M_{\odot} model at TAMS.
