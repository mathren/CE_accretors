  abstract = {Common-envelope (CE) evolution in massive binary systems is thought to be one of the most promising channels for the formation of compact binary mergers. In the case of merging binary black holes (BBHs), the essential CE phase takes place at a stage when the first BH is already formed and the companion star expands as a supergiant. We study which BH binaries with supergiant companions will evolve through and potentially survive a CE phase. To this end, we compute envelope binding energies from detailed massive stellar models at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. We make multiple physically extreme choices of assumptions that favor easier CE ejection as well as account for recent advancements in mass transfer stability criteria. We find that even with the most optimistic assumptions, a successful CE ejection in BH (and also NS) binaries is only possible if the donor is a massive convective-envelope giant, a red supergiant (RSG). In other words, pre-CE progenitors of BBH mergers are BH binaries with RSG companions. We find that due to its influence on the radial expansion of massive giants, metallicity has an indirect but a very strong effect on the envelope structure and binding energies of RSGs. Our results suggest that merger rates from population synthesis models could be severely overestimated, especially at low metallicity. Additionally, the lack of observed RSGs with luminosities above log(\$L/L\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) = 5.6-5.8, corresponding to stars with \$M {$>$} 40 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, puts into question the viability of the CE channel for the formation of the most massive BBH mergers. Either such RSGs elude detection due to very short lifetimes, or they do not exist and the CE channel can only produce BBH systems with masses \${$<$} 50 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Finally, we discuss an alternative CE scenario, in which a partial envelope ejection is followed by a phase of possibly long and stable mass transfer.},

  abstract = {Stable mass transfer from a massive post-main sequence (post-MS) donor is thought to be a short-lived event of thermal-timescale mass transfer which strips the donor star of nearly its entire H-rich envelope, producing a hot helium star. This long-standing picture is based on stellar models with Hertzprung gap (HG) donors. Motivated by a finding that in low-metallicity  binaries, post-MS mass transfer may instead be initiated by core-helium burning (CHeB) donors, we use the MESA code to compute grids of detailed massive binary models at three metallicities: Solar and that of the Large and the Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC). We find that metallicity strongly influences the course and outcome of mass transfer. We identify two novel types of post-MS mass transfer: (a) mass exchange on the long nuclear timescale that continues until the end of the CHeB phase, and (b) rapid mass transfer leading to detached binaries with mass-losers that are only partially stripped of their envelopes. In neither (a) or (b) does the donor become a fully stripped helium star by the end of CHeB. Boundaries between the different types of post-MS mass transfer are associated with the degree of rapid post-MS expansion and, for a given metallicity, are sensitive to the assumptions about internal mixing. At low metallicity, we predict fewer hot fully stripped stars formed through binary interactions and higher compactness of pre-supernova cores. Nuclear-timescale post-MS mass transfer suggests a strong preference for metal-poor host galaxies of ultra-luminous X-ray sources with black-hole (BH) accretors and massive donors, some of which might be the immediate progenitors of binary BH mergers. It also implies a population of interacting binaries with blue and yellow supergiant donors. Partially-stripped stars could potentially explain the puzzling nitrogen-enriched slowly-rotating (super)giants in the LMC.},

  abstract = {As the number of observed merging binary black holes (BHs) grows, accurate models are required to disentangle multiple formation channels. In models with isolated binaries, important uncertainties remain regarding the stability of mass transfer (MT) and common-envelope (CE) evolution. To study some of these uncertainties, we have computed simulations using MESA of a \$30M\_\textbackslash odot\$, low metallicity (\$Z\_\textbackslash odot/10\$) star with a BH companion. We developed a prescription to compute MT rates including possible outflows from outer Lagrangian points, and a method to self-consistently determine the core-envelope boundary in the case of CE evolution. We find that binaries survive a CE only if unstable MT happens after the formation of a deep convective envelope, resulting in a narrow range (0.2 dex) in period for envelope ejection. All cases where interaction is initiated with a radiative envelope have large binding energies (\$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{50\}\$ erg), and merge during CE even under the assumption that all the internal and recombination energy of the envelope, as well as the energy from an inspiral, is used for ejection. This is independent of core helium ignition for the donor, a condition under which various rapid-population synthesis calculations assume a successful ejection is possible. Moreover, we find that the critical mass ratio for instability is such that for periods between \$\textbackslash sim 1-1000\$ days merging binary BHs can be formed via stable MT. A large fraction of these systems overflow their L\$\_2\$ equipotential, in which case we find stable MT produces merging binary BHs even under extreme assumptions of mass and angular momentum outflows. Our conclusions are limited to the study of one donor star, but suggest that population synthesis calculations overestimate the formation rate of merging binary BHs produced by CE evolution, and that stable MT could dominate the rate from isolated binaries.},

We also find that a natal kick distribution composed of both low (Maxwellian {$\sigma$} = 30 km s-1) and high ({$\sigma$} = 265 km s-1) components is preferred over a single high-kick component. We conclude that the observed DNS mass distribution can place strong constraints on model assumptions.},

  abstract = {Anticipating the kinematic constraints from the Gaia mission, we perform an extensive numerical study of the evolution of massive binary systems to predict the peculiar velocities that stars obtain when their companion collapses and disrupts the system. Our aim is to (1) identify which predictions are robust against model uncertainties and assess their implications, (2) investigate which physical processes leave a clear imprint and may therefore be constrained observationally and (3) provide a suite of publicly available model predictions We find that 22 +26 -8 \% of all massive binary systems merge prior to the first core collapse in the system. Of the remainder, 86 +11 -9 \% become unbound because of the core-collapse. Remarkably, this rarely produce runaway stars (i.e., stars with velocities above 30 km s -1). These are outnumbered by more than an order of magnitude by slower unbound companions, or "walkaway stars". This is a robust outcome of our simulations and is due to the reversal of the mass ratio prior to the explosion and widening of the orbit, as we show analytically and numerically. We estimate a 10 +5 -8 \% of massive stars to be walkaways and only 0.5 +1.0 -0.4 \% to be runaways, nearly all of which have accreted mass from their companion. Our findings are consistent with earlier studies, however the low runaway fraction we find is in tension with observed fractions {$\sim$}10\%. If Gaia confirms these high fractions of massive runaway stars resulting from binaries, it would imply that we are currently missing physics in the binary models. Finally, we show that high end of the mass distributions of runaway stars is very sensitive to the assumed black hole natal kicks and propose this as a potentially stringent test for the explosion mechanism. We also discuss companions remaining bound which can evolve into X-ray and gravitational wave sources.},

  abstract = {The merger of two massive 30 Msun black holes has been detected in gravitational waves (1,GW150914). This discovery validates recent predictions (2-4) that massive binary black holes would constitute the first detection. However, previous calculations have not sampled the relevant binary black hole progenitors---massive, low-metallicity binary stars---with sufficient accuracy and input physics to enable robust predictions to better than several orders of magnitude (5-10). Here we report a suite of high-precision numerical simulations of binary black hole formation via the evolution of isolated binary stars, providing a framework to interpret GW150914 and predict the properties of subsequent binary black hole gravitational-wave events. Our models imply that these events form in an environment where the metallicity is less than 10 percent of solar; have initial masses of 40-100 Msun; and interact through mass transfer and a common envelope phase. Their progenitors likely form either at 2 Gyr, or somewhat less likely, at 11 Gyr after the Big Bang. Most binary black holes form without supernova explosions, and their spins are nearly unchanged since birth, but do not have to be parallel. The classical field formation of binary black holes proposed in this study, with low natal kicks and restricted common envelope evolution, produces 40 times more binary black holes than dynamical formation channels involving globular clusters (11) and is comparable to the rate from homogeneous evolution channels (12-15). Our calculations predict detections of about 1,000 black hole mergers per year with total mass of 20-80 Msun once second generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories reach full sensitivity.},

This mass transfer was previously postulated to be unstable and was expected to lead to a common envelope event. The common envelope event then would end with either double black hole formation, or with the merger of the two stars. We re-visit the stability of this mass transfer, and find that for a large range of the binary orbital separations this mass transfer is stable. This newly found stability allows us to reconcile the theoretical rate for double black hole binary mergers predicted by population synthesis studies, and the empirical rate obtained by LIGO. Futhermore, the stability of the mass transfer leads to the formation of ultra-luminous X-ray sources. The theoretically predicted formation rates of ultra-luminous X-ray sources powered by a stellar-mass BH, as well as the range of produced X-ray luminosity, can explain the observed bright ultra-luminous X-ray sources.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Unusually for CEE-related work, we mostly try to avoid relying on results from population synthesis or observations, in order to avoid potentially being misled by previous misunderstandings. As far as possible we debate all the relevant issues starting from physics alone, all the way from the evolution of the binary system immediately before CEE begins to the processes which might occur just after the ejection of the envelope. In particular, we include extensive discussion about the energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence examine the foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is also given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from different groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial conditions on the differences in the outcomes. We compare current numerical techniques for the problem of CEE and also whether more appropriate tools could and should be produced (including new formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and attempts to include 3D processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways to link CEE with observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the recent outburst from V1309 Sco, and discuss to what extent post-common-envelope binaries and nebulae can provide information, e.g. from binary eccentricities, which is not currently being fully exploited.},

  abstract = {We analyze two binary systems containing giant stars, V723 Mon (``the Unicorn'') and 2M04123153+6738486 (``the Giraffe''). Both giants orbit more massive but less luminous companions, previously proposed to be mass-gap black holes. Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like spectra in both systems. Joint modeling of the spectra, light curves, and spectral energy distributions robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and radii of both components: the primaries are luminous, cool giants ({$\mathsl{T}$}eff, giant = 3, 800 K and 4, 000 K, {$\mathsl{R}$}giant = 22.5 {$\mathsl{R}$} and 25 {$\mathsl{R}$} ) with exceptionally low masses ({$\mathsl{M}$}giant {$\approx$} 0.4 {$\mathsl{M}$} ) that likely fill their Roche lobes. The secondaries are only slightly warmer subgiants ({$\mathsl{T}$}eff, 2 = 5, 800 K and 5, 150 K, {$\mathsl{R}$}2 = 8.3 {$\mathsl{R}$} and 9 {$\mathsl{R}$} ) and thus are consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars with similar masses ({$\mathsl{M}$}2 {$\approx$} 2.8 {$\mathsl{M}$} and {$\approx$} 1.8 {$\mathsl{M}$} ). In the Unicorn, rapid rotation blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making it challenging to detect even at wavelengths where it dominates the total light. Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing and subsequent envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary evolution models in which a 1 - 2 {$\mathsl{M}$} primary is stripped by a companion as it ascends the giant branch. The fact that the companions are also evolved implies either that the initial mass ratio was very near unity, or that the companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn and Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely-observed phase of binary evolution preceding the formation of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually, compact binaries containing two helium white dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are expected to be very common in the Milky Way, but their intrinsic faintness challenges the detection of these systems. Currently, only a few tens of detached DWDs are know. Such systems offer the best chance of extracting the physical properties that would allow us to address a wealth of out standing questions ranging from the nature of white dwarfs and thermo nuclear supernovae, over stellar and binary evolution to mapping the Galaxy. In this paper, we explore the prospects for detections of ultra-compact (with binary separations of a few solar radii or less) detached DWDs in (1) optical radiation with Gaia and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and (2) gravitational wave radiation with Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LISA). We show that Gaia, LSST and LISA have the potential to detect, respectively, around a few hundred, a thousand and 25 thousand DWD systems. Moreover, Gaia and LSST data will extend by, respectively, a factor of 2 and 7 the guaranteed sample of LISA verification sources, binaries detectable in electromagnetic and gravitational wave radiation, opening the era of multimessenger astronomy for these sources.},

For the case of a rotating radiation-driven wind the velocity field is obtained analytically using a parameterised description of the line acceleration that only depends on radius r at any given latitude \texttheta. The line acceleration g(r) is obtained from Monte-Carlo multi-line radiative transfer calculations. The critical/sonic point of our equation of motion varies with latitude \texttheta. Furthermore, an approximate analytical solution for the supersonic flow of a rotating wind is derived, which is found to closely resemble the exact solution. For the simultaneous solution of the mass-loss rate and velocity field, we use the iterative method of our 1D method extended to the non-spherical 2D case. We apply the new theoretical expressions with our iterative method to the stellar wind from a differentially rotating 40 M{$\cdot$} O5-V main sequence star as well as to a 60 M {$\cdot$} O-giant star, and we compare our results to previous studies that are extensions of the Castor et al. (1975, ApJ, 195, 157) CAK formalism. Next, we account for the effects of oblateness and gravity darkening. Our numerical results predict an equatorial decrease of the mass-loss rate, which would imply that (surface-averaged) total mass-loss rates are lower than for the spherical 1D case, in contradiction to the Maeder \& Meynet (2000, A\&A, 361, 159) formalism that is oftentimes employed in stellar evolution calculations for rotating massive stars. To clarify the situation in nature we discuss observational tests to constrain the shapes of large-scale 2D stellar winds. \textcopyright{} 2014 ESO.},

  abstract = {The understanding of the rotational evolution of early-type stars is deeply related to that of anisotropic mass and angular momentum loss. In this paper, we aim to clarify the rotational evolution of rapidly rotating early-type stars along the main sequence (MS). We have used the 2D ESTER code to compute and evolve isolated rapidly rotating early-type stellar models along the MS, with and without anisotropic mass loss. We show that stars with Z = 0:02 and masses between 5 and 7 M reach criticality during the main sequence provided their initial angular velocity is larger than 50\% of the Keplerian one. More massive stars are subject to radiationdriven winds and to an associated loss of mass and angular momentum.We find that this angular momentum extraction from the outer layers can prevent massive stars from reaching critical rotation and greatly reduce the degree of criticality at the end of the MS. Our model includes the so-called bi-stability jump of the M-Teff relation of 1D-models. This discontinuity now shows up in the latitude variations of the mass-flux surface density, endowing rotating massive stars with either a single-wind regime (no discontinuity) or a two-wind regime (a discontinuity). In the two-wind regime, mass loss and angular momentum loss are strongly increased at low latitudes inducing a faster slow-down of the rotation. However, predicting the rotational fate of a massive star is difficult, mainly because of the non-linearity of the phenomena involved and their strong dependence on uncertain prescriptions. Moreover, the very existence of the bi-stability jump in mass-loss rate remains to be substantiated by observations.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} ESO, 2017. Mass loss processes are a key uncertainty in the evolution of massive stars. They determine the amount of mass and angular momentum retained by the star, thus influencing its evolution and presupernova structure. Because of the high complexity of the physical processes driving mass loss, stellar evolution calculations must employ parametric algorithms, and usually only include wind mass loss. We carried out an extensive parameter study of wind mass loss and its effects on massive star evolution using the open-source stellar evolution code MESA. We provide a systematic comparison of wind mass loss algorithms for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial mass range of 15 Mo to 35 Mo. We consider combinations drawn from two hot phase (i.e., roughly the main sequence) algorithms, three cool phase (i.e., post-main-sequence) algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet mass loss algorithms. We discuss separately the effects of mass loss in each of these phases. In addition, we consider linear wind efficiency scale factors of 1, 0.33, and 0.1 to account for suggested reductions in mass loss rates due to wind inhomogeneities. We find that the initial to final mass mapping for each zero-Age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass has a \textasciitilde{} 50\% uncertainty if all algorithm combinations and wind efficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale factor dominates this uncertainty. While the final total mass and internal structure of our models vary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final luminosity and effective temperature are much less sensitive for stars with ZAMS mass {$\lessequivlnt$}30 M \& odo. This indicates that uncertainty in wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS mass of most single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations. Our results furthermore show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is sensitive to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss. The compactness parameter {$\xi$} {$\infty$}M/R(M) has been identified as a proxy for the explodability of a given presupernova model. We find that {$\xi$} varies by as much as 30\% for models of the same ZAMS mass evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass loss algorithm combinations. This suggests that the details of the mass loss treatment might bias the outcome of detailed core-collapse supernova calculations and the predictions for neutron star and black hole formation.},

  abstract = {We investigate the interaction of mass loss and rotation during core hydrogen burning in massive stars. We compute their main sequence evolution assuming rigid rotation, and carry angular momentum as a passive quantity in the stellar interior but incorporate its effect on the stellar mass loss rate. We consider the example of a 60M{$\odot$} star assuming various initial rotation rates. We show that rotation may substantially enhance the total main sequence mass loss of massive stars. Furthermore, we argue that the surface layers of rotating massive main sequence stars may reach the limit of hydrostatic stability ("{$\Omega$}-limit") by achieving a considerable fraction of their Eddington luminosity. We show that this process is not catastrophic for the star, but rather that the coupling of mass and angular momentum loss limits the mass loss rate \.M{$\Omega$} of main sequence stars at the {$\Omega$}-limit. \.M{$\Omega$} is determined through the angular momentum loss imposed by the {$\Omega$}-limit rather than by atomic physics. For our 60M{$\odot$} sequences, it is \.M{$\Omega$} {$\simeq$} 10-5M{$\odot$} yr-1. We find a convergence of the rotational velocities of main sequence stars of a given initial mass at the {$\Omega$}-limit, but a strong dependance of their mass at core hydrogen exhaustion from the initial rotation rate. Since then also the post-main sequence evolution depends on the initial amount of angular momentum, we argue that this is a third independent initial parameter for the evolution of massive stars, as important as initial mass and metallicity. We briefly discuss observable consequences of the coupling of mass and angular momentum loss, e.g. a significant decline of the projected rotational velocity v sin i towards the cool end of the main sequence, a period of strongly enhanced and aspherical mass loss, disks or rings in the equatorial plane of the star reminiscent of B[e]-stars, and highly bipolar circumstellar structures.},

Here we report on Hubble Space Telescope/STIS far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of a sample of Be stars that reveals the presence of the hot sdO companion through the calculation of cross-correlation functions of the observed and model spectra. We clearly detect the spectral signature of the sdO star in 10 of the 13 stars in the sample, and the spectral signals indicate that the sdO stars are hot, relatively faint, and slowly rotating as predicted by models. A comparison of their temperatures and radii with evolutionary tracks indicates that the sdO stars occupy the relatively long-lived, He-core burning stage. Only one of the ten detections was a known binary prior to this investigation, which emphasizes the difficulty of finding such Be+sdO binaries through optical spectroscopy.

While binary interactions and their high incidence are generally cited to favor them as Type IIb SN progenitors, this idea has not been tested using models covering a broad parameter space. In this paper we use single- and binary-star models at solar and low metallicities covering a broad parameter space to investigate the progenitors of and evolutionary pathways to Type IIb SNe. We find that single and binary stars contribute roughly the same as Type IIb SNe at solar metallicity. Binary stars only dominate as progenitors at low metallicity. We also find that our models can account for less than half the observationally inferred rate for Type IIb SNe at high metallicity, making up {$<$}4.5\% of all core-collapse (CC) SNe. On the other hand, our models can account for the rates currently indicated by observations at low metallicity, making up 0.5-15\% of all CC SNe. However, this requires low mass transfer efficiencies (\textasciitilde 0.1) to prevent most progenitors from entering contact. We suggest that the stellar wind mass-loss rates at solar metallicity used in our models are too high. Lower mass-loss rates would widen the parameter space for binary Type IIb SNe at solar metallicity by allowing stars that initiate mass transfer earlier in their evolution to reach CC without getting fully stripped.},

  abstract	= {{Context. The initial distribution of spin rates of
		  massive stars is a fingerprint of their elusive formation
		  process. It also sets a key initial condition for stellar
		  evolution and is thus an important ingredient in stellar
		  population synthesis. So far, most studies have focused on
		  single stars. Most O stars are, however, found in multiple
		  systems. <BR /> Aims: By establishing the spin-rate
		  distribution of a sizeable sample of O-type spectroscopic
		  binaries and by comparing the distributions of binary
		  subpopulations with one another and with that of
		  presumed-single stars in the same region, we aim to
		  constrain the initial spin distribution of O stars in
		  binaries, and to identify signatures of the physical
		  mechanisms that affect the evolution of the spin rates of
		  massive stars. <BR /> Methods: We use ground-based optical
		  spectroscopy obtained in the framework of the VLT-FLAMES
		  Tarantula Survey (VFTS) to establish the projected
		  equatorial rotational velocities ({$\nu$}$_{e}$sini) for
		  components of 114 spectroscopic binaries in 30 Doradus. The
		  {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini values are derived from the full width at
		  half maximum (FWHM) of a set of spectral lines, using a
		  FWHM vs. {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini calibration that we derive based
		  on previous line analysis methods applied to single O-type
		  stars in the VFTS sample. <BR /> Results: The overall
		  {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini distribution of the primary stars
		  resembles that of single O-type stars in the VFTS,
		  featuring a low-velocity peak (at {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini{\lt}
		  200 kms$^{-1}$) and a shoulder at intermediate velocities
		  (200 {\lt} {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini{\lt} 300 kms$^{-1}$). The
		  distributions of binaries and single stars, however, differ
		  in two ways. First, the main peak at {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini \~{}
		  100kms$^{-1}$ is broader and slightly shifted towards
		  higher spin rates in the binary distribution than that of
		  the presumed-single stars. This shift is mostly due to
		  short-period binaries (P$_{orb}$$_{~}${\lt} 10 d). Second,
		  the {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini distribution of primaries lacks a
		  significant population of stars spinning faster than 300
		  kms$^{-1}$, while such a population is clearly present in
		  the single-star sample. The {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini distribution
		  of binaries with amplitudes of radial velocity variation in
		  the range of 20 to 200 kms$^{-1}$ (mostly binaries with
		  P$_{orb}$ \~{} 10-1000 d and/or with q{\lt} 0.5) is similar
		  to that of single O stars below
		  {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini$_{~}${\lt} 170kms$^{-1}$. <BR />
		  Conclusions: Our results are compatible with the assumption
		  that binary components formed with the same spin
		  distribution as single stars, and that this distribution
		  contains few or no fast-spinning stars. The higher average
		  spin rate of stars in short-period binaries may either be
		  explained by spin-up through tides in such tight binary
		  systems, or by spin-down of a fraction of the
		  presumed-single stars and long-period binaries through
		  magnetic braking (or by a combination of both mechanisms).
		  Most primaries and secondaries of SB2 systems with
		  P$_{orb}$$_{~}${\lt} 10 d appear to have similar rotational
		  velocities. This is in agreement with tidal locking in
		  close binaries where the components have similar radii. The
		  lack of very rapidly spinning stars among binary systems
		  supports the idea that most stars with
		  {$\nu$}$_{e}$sini$_{~}${\gt} 300kms$^{-1}$ in the
		  single-star sample are actually spun-up post-binary
		  interaction products. Finally, the overall similarities
		  (low-velocity peak and intermediate-velocity shoulder) of
		  the spin distribution of binary and single stars argue for
		  a massive star formation process in which the initial spin
		  is set independently of whether stars are formed as single
		  stars or as components of a binary system.

  abstract = {Massive binaries that merge as compact objects are the progenitors of gravitational-wave sources. Most of these binaries experience one or more phases of mass transfer, during which one of the stars loses all or part of its outer envelope and becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size of these stripped stars is crucial in determining whether they experience further interactions and understanding their ultimate fate. We present new calculations of stripped-envelope stars based on binary evolution models computed with MESA. We use these to investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and metallicity. We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics and potential consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae from stripped stars. At high metallicity, we find that practically all of the hydrogen-rich envelope is removed, which is in agreement with earlier findings. Only progenitors with initial masses below 10 M{$\cdot$} expand to large radii (up to 100 R{$\cdot$} ), while more massive progenitors remain compact. At low metallicity, a substantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors can, in principle, expand to giant sizes ({$>$} 400 R{$\cdot$} ) for all masses we consider. This implies that they can fill their Roche lobe anew. We show that the prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis models underestimate the stellar radii by up to two orders of magnitude. We expect that this has consequences for the predictions for gravitational-wave sources from double neutron star mergers, particularly with regard to their metallicity dependence.},

Our results were not so consistent with classical models by Wheeler et al. 1975, sometimes deviating by an order of magnitude. We construct an alternative simple model which explains the simulated results reasonably well and can be used to estimate impact velocities for arbitrary explosion profiles and companion star structures. We then investigate the long term evolution after the supernova, where the companion can be inflated by the energy injected into the star. We find that the companion can become more than an order of magnitude overluminous straight after the supernova, but quickly fades away after \$\textbackslash sim10\$ years and returns to its original luminosity in about a thermal timescale of the star.

  abstract = {Gravitational-wave detections are now starting to probe the mass distribution of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). Robust predictions from stellar models are needed to interpret these. Theory predicts the existence of a gap in the BH mass distribution because of pair-instability supernova. The maximum BH mass below the gap is the result of pulsational mass loss. We evolve massive helium stars through their late hydrodynamical phases of evolution using the open-source MESA stellar evolution code. We find that the location of the lower edge of the mass gap at 45\$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ is remarkably robust against variations in the metallicity (\$\textbackslash approx 3M\_\textbackslash odot\$), the treatment of internal mixing (\$\textbackslash approx 1M\_\textbackslash odot\$), stellar wind mass loss (\$\textbackslash approx 4M\_\textbackslash odot\$), making it the most robust predictions for the final stages of massive star evolution. The reason is that the onset of the instability is dictated by the near-final core mass, which in turn sets the resulting BH mass. However, varying \$\^\{12\}C\textbackslash left(\textbackslash alpha,\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash right)\^\{16\}O\$ reaction rate within its \$1\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainties shifts the location of the gap between \$40M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$56M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We provide updated analytic fits for population synthesis simulations. Our results imply that the detection of merging BHs can provide constraints on nuclear astrophysics. Furthermore, the robustness against metallicity suggests that there is a universal maximum for the location of the lower edge of the gap, which is insensitive to the formation environment and redshift for first-generation BHs. This is promising for the possibility to use the location of the gap as a "standard siren" across the Universe.},

  abstract = {Binary population synthesis (BPS) employs prescriptions to predict final fates, explosion or implosion, and remnant masses based on one or two stellar parameters at the evolutionary cutoff imposed by the code, usually at or near central carbon ignition. In doing this, BPS disregards the integral role late-stage evolution plays in determining the final fate, remnant type, and remnant mass within the neutrino-driven explosion paradigm. To highlight differences between a popular prescription which relies only on the core and final stellar mass and emerging methods which rely on a star's presupernova core structure, we generate a series of compact object distributions using three different methods for a sample population of single and binary stars computed in BPASS. The first method estimates remnant mass based on a star's carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass and final total mass. The second method uses the presupernova core structure based on the bare CO-core models of \textbackslash citet\{Pat20\} combined with a parameterized explosion criterion to first determine final fate and remnant type, then remnant mass. The third method associates presupernova helium-core masses with remnant masses determined from public explosion models which rely implicitly on core structure. We find that the core-/final mass-based prescription favors lower mass remnants, including a large population of mass gap black holes, and predicts neutron star masses which span a wide range, whereas the structure-based prescriptions favor slightly higher mass remnants, mass gap black holes only as low as 3.5 \textbackslash Msun, and predict neutron star mass distributions which cluster in a narrow range.},

  abstract = {Population synthesis relies on semi-analytic formulae to determine masses of compact objects from the (helium or carbon-oxygen) cores of collapsing stars. Such formulae are combined across mass ranges that span different explosion mechanisms, potentialy introducing artificial features in the compact object mass distribution. Such artifacts impair the interpretation of gravitational-wave observations. We propose a ``top-down'' remnant mass prescription where we remove mass from the star for each possible mass-loss mechanism, instead of relying on the fallback onto a ``proto-compact-object'' to get the final mass. For one of these mass-loss mechanisms, we fit the metallicity-dependent mass lost to pulsational-pair instability supernovae from numerical simulations. By imposing no mass loss in the absence of pulses, our approach recovers the existing compact object masses prescription at the low mass end and ensures continuity across the core-collapse/pulsational-pair-instability regime. Our remnant mass prescription can be extended to include other mass-loss mechanisms at the final collapse.},

  abstract = {The mass distribution of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes provides vital clues into the nature of stellar core collapse and the physical engine responsible for supernova explosions. A number of supernova engines have been proposed: neutrino- or oscillation-driven explosions enhanced by early (developing in 10-50?ms) and late-time (developing in 200?ms) convection as well as magnetic field engines (in black hole accretion disks or neutron stars). Using our current understanding of supernova engines, we derive mass distributions of stellar compact remnants. We provide analytic prescriptions for both single-star models (as a function of initial star mass) and for binary-star models?prescriptions for compact object masses for major population synthesis codes. These prescriptions have implications for a range of observations: X-ray binary populations, supernova explosion energies, and gravitational wave sources. We show that advanced gravitational radiation detectors (like LIGO/VIRGO or the Einstein Telescope) will be able to further test the supernova explosion engine models once double black hole inspirals are detected.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Massive stars briefly pass through the yellow supergiant (YSG) phase as they evolve redward across the H-R diagram and expand into red supergiants (RSGs). Higher-mass stars pass through the YSG phase again as they evolve blueward after experiencing significant RSG mass loss. These post-RSG objects offer us a tantalizing glimpse into which stars end their lives as RSGs and why. One telltale sign of a post-RSG object may be an instability to pulsations, depending on the star’s interior structure. Here we report the discovery of five YSGs with pulsation periods faster than 1 day, found in a sample of 76 cool supergiants observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite at a two-minute cadence. These pulsating YSGs are concentrated in an H-R diagram region not previously associated with pulsations; we conclude that this is a genuine new class of pulsating star, fast yellow pulsating supergiants (FYPSs). For each FYPS, we extract frequencies via iterative prewhitening and conduct a time-frequency analysis. One FYPS has an extracted frequency that is split into a triplet, and the amplitude of that peak is modulated on the same timescale as the frequency spacing of the triplet; neither rotation nor binary effects are likely culprits. We discuss the evolutionary status of FYPS and conclude that they are candidate post-RSGs. All stars in our sample also show the same stochastic low-frequency variability found in hot OB stars and attributed to internal gravity waves. Finally, we find four α Cygni variables in our sample, of which three are newly discovered.}
