Access the latest successful build of the manuscript from the badge
above.

You can see the source in =src/tex/CE_accretors.tex=, which you can edit
and should be able to compile locally.

** Why care about the first mass transfer on future common envelope?

   Most binary evolution scenarios for gravitational wave sources rely
   on a common envelope (CE) to reduce the separation (exceptions are
   chemically homogeneous evolution and stable RLOF). The CE is
   initiated by a star that has previously accreted mass during a RLOF
   phase.

   We want to study how the previous accretion through RLOF influences
   the radial evolution and the binding energy of the models. This is
   because rejuvenation acts on the core-envelope boundary.

** Migration to new showyourwork

   On =fi_w= excluding time to download the tarball from zenodo, but
   doing all the processing to intermediate results and upload on cache:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   real    30m13.209s
   user    27m9.104s
   sys     0m59.076s
#+END_SRC

*** DONE Simple test
    The scripts =convert_MESA_output.py= should create  =src/data/try.npy=.
    =zenodo_plotter.py= reads it and creates a figure.
*** DONE downloading tarball and converting
*** DONE cleanup figures

    - [X] Refactor scripts in =/src/figures/=.
    - [X] change =graphicspath= in =CE_accretors.tex.=
    - [X] Remove figures from repo

*** DONE caching of intermediate results

    - [X] modify Snakemake file to have caching
    - [X] modify dependencies in =showyourwork.yml=
    - [X] modify tex file to include figure

*** TODO browsable folders on zenodo

    - [ ] right now the cache on [[https://sandbox.zenodo.org/deposit/1071935][zenodo sandbox]] re-uploads a megafolder

*** Issue to report on =showyourwork=
***** =./showyourwork/cache/= becomes pretty huge pretty fast: clean-up?


** TODO Document How to reproduce the engineered models

   - [ ] save in repo
     =/ssh:fi_w:/mnt/home/mrenzo/Templates/binary_mesa/simplified_profile=
     this contains modified inputs and template
   - [ ] document this
